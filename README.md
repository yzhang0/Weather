# Weather
With a luggage full of summer dresses and short sleeves, I was (unwelcomingly) welcomed into the windy city of San Francisco. This raised an interesting question for me, is San Francisco really warmer than my average Canadian Summer? Here, I quickly put together a data visualization of 2017 weather across the globe to satisfy my curiosity.

### Dataset:
* https://www.wunderground.com/
### Acknowledgments:

### Data scraping:
* Used CSVs directly from the history feature
* Potential improvement: Use Selenium to select cities and dataset automatically
### Data cleaning:
* Used pandas
### Data visualization:
* I used the amazing visualization from bl.ocks by 3noob above.
* Potential improvement: Add additional fields (max/min temperature, rain, etc)

### Final project:
* https://yzhang0.github.io/weather2017.html
