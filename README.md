# Weather
With a luggage full of summer dresses and short sleeves, I was (unwelcomingly) welcomed into the windy city of San Francisco. This raised an interesting question for me, is San Francisco really warmer than my average Canadian Summer? Here, I quickly put together a data visualization of 2017 weather across the globe to satisfy my curiosity.

Data scraping: using CSVs directly from the history feature
=> Potential improvement:
=> Use Selenium to select cities and dataset automatically
=> Increase number of cities to Top 20 Cities
Data cleaning: using pandas
Data visualization: I simply used the amazing visualization from bl.ocks by DStruths above. No change at all.
=> Potential improvement:
=> Add additional fields (max/min temperature, rain, etc)
